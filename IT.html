    <h2><em>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT Start?</em></h2>
    <div class= "parabord">
    <p>I am interested in all parts of IT, from the software/developing program side to the hardware side of IT such as computer parts, building and setting up systems/networks. Although I prefer more of the hardware side rather than the software as coding can be a pain sometimes. My interest in IT has always stuck with me since I was young. It started from console games that I used to play when I was younger on the PS3 and eventually I transitioned into PC games and from that point on, I've just been genuinely interested in technology. My computer was also the only thing that I would use mostly, so IT just stuck out to me compared to any other path. </p>

    <h2><em>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</em></h2>
    <div class= "parabord">
    <p>The reason why I chose to come to RMIT specifically was because of what it had to offer. For convenience and also because it aligned with the career path of IT. I had originally wanted to go to Victoria University in Footscray Park as they also offered something similar and was closer but I chose RMIT after hearing and asking around, to which a lot of people had said they also had attended this same university. Afterwards I changed my first preference to RMIT, with the thought that the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology would surely offer the best when it comes to technology. </p>

    <h2><em>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</em></h2>
      <div class= "parabord">
    <p>During my time at RMIT, I hope to acquire and improve on some current skills. These include teamwork, problem-solving and developing my understanding of the inner workings of technology and it can impact the world around us. I expect to learn how to program and code at a better level, if possible, learn a variety of programming languages along the way, what is required and expected within the IT industry learning about the many paths of IT that can be pursued. While doing that I also
      wish to improve on my communication skills such as collaborating in group projects, seeking advice from my fellow IT peers and to converse effectively with clients. </p> </div>
