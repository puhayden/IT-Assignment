  <p>I am currently 19, born on the 22nd of February. Both my parents were born in East Timor (it’s a small country located near Indonesia), meaning that they are both Timorese making me also Timorese! At home, we speak Hakka which is a chinese dialect commonly spoken by residents of East Timor. In my family of 6 (including me), I have 3 other older brothers and a mother and father. I am the youngest in my family with an age gap of 13 years between me and the third oldest brother.</p>

  <p>As of now, my occupation is a cashier and customer service team member at Woolworths and have been working there for 2 years (great first job!). Now moving onto my hobbies… mainly just PC gaming and watching anime. I tend to switch back and forth between games but I mostly play League of Legends and VALORANT. When it comes to anime I don’t always watch it but I'll have random periods where I'll just binge one entire series then go back into a hiatus until I suddenly get the urge to watch.
